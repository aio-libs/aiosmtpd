 Handlers
==========

Handlers are classes which can implement :ref:`hook methods <hooks>` that get
called at various points in the SMTP dialog.  Handlers can also be named on
the :ref:`command line <cli>`, but if the class's constructor takes arguments,
you must define a ``@classmethod`` that converts the positional arguments and
returns a handler instance:

``from_cli(cls, parser, *args)``
    Convert the positional arguments, as strings passed in on the command
    line, into a handler instance.  ``parser`` is the ArgumentParser_ instance
    in use.

If ``from_cli()`` is not defined, the handler can still be used on the command
line, but its constructor cannot accept arguments.


.. _hooks:

Handler hooks
=============

Handlers can implement hooks that get called during the SMTP dialog, or in
exceptional cases.  These *handler hooks* are all called asynchronously
(i.e. they are coroutines) and they *must* return a status string, such as
``'250 OK'``.  All handler hooks are optional and default behaviors are
carried out by the ``SMTP`` class when a hook is omitted, so you only need to
implement the ones you care about.  When a handler hook is defined, it may
have additional responsibilities as described below.

All handler hooks take at least three arguments, the ``SMTP`` server instance,
:ref:`a session instance, and an envelope instance <sessions_and_envelopes>`.
Some methods take additional arguments.

The following hooks are currently defined:

``handle_HELO(server, session, envelope, hostname)``
    Called during ``HELO``.  The ``hostname`` argument is the host name given
    by the client in the ``HELO`` command.  If implemented, this hook must
    also set the ``session.host_name`` attribute before returning
    ``'250 {}'.format(server.hostname)`` as the status.

``handle_EHLO(server, session, envelope, hostname)``
    Called during ``EHLO``.  The ``hostname`` argument is the host name given
    by the client in the ``EHLO`` command.  If implemented, this hook must
    also set the ``session.host_name`` attribute.  This hook may push
    additional ``250-<command>`` responses to the client by yielding from
    ``server.push(status)`` before returning ``250 HELP`` as the final
    response.

``handle_NOOP(server, session, envelope)``
    Called during ``NOOP``.

``handle_QUIT(server, session, envelope)``
    Called during ``QUIT``.

``handle_VRFY(server, session, envelope, address)``
    Called during ``VRFY``.  The ``address`` argument is the parsed email
    address given by the client in the ``VRFY`` command.

``handle_MAIL(server, session, envelope, address, mail_options)``
    Called during ``MAIL FROM``.  The ``address`` argument is the parsed email
    address given by the client in the ``MAIL FROM`` command, and
    ``mail_options`` are any additional ESMTP mail options providing by the
    client.  If implemented, this hook must also set the
    ``envelope.mail_from`` attribute and it may extend
    ``envelope.mail_options`` (which is always a Python list).

``handle_RCPT(server, session, envelope, address, rcpt_options)``
    Called during ``RCPT TO``.  The ``address`` argument is the parsed email
    address given by the client in the ``RCPT TO`` command, and
    ``rcpt_options`` are any additional ESMTP recipient options providing by
    the client.  If implemented, this hook should append the address to
    ``envelope.rcpt_tos`` and may extend ``envelope.rcpt_options`` (both of
    which are always Python lists).

``handle_RSET(server, session, envelope)``
    Called during ``RSET``.

``handle_DATA(server, session, envelope)``
    Called during ``DATA`` after the entire message (`"SMTP content"
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-2.3.9>`_ as described in
    RFC 5321) has been received.  The content is available on the ``envelope``
    object, but the values are dependent on whether the ``SMTP`` class was
    instantiated with ``decode_data=False`` (the default) or
    ``decode_data=True``.  In the former case, both ``envelope.content`` and
    ``envelope.original_content`` will be the content bytes (normalized
    according to the transparency rules in `RFC 5321, ยง4.5.2
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-4.5.2>`_).  In the latter
    case, ``envelope.original_content`` will be the normalized bytes, but
    ``envelope.content`` will be the UTF-8 decoded string of the original
    content.

In addition to the SMTP command hooks, the following hooks can also be
implemented by handlers.  These have different APIs, and are called
synchronously (i.e. they are **not** coroutines).

``handle_STARTTLS(server, session, envelope)``
    If implemented, and if SSL is supported, this method gets called
    during the TLS handshake phase of ``connection_made()``.  It should return
    True if the handshake succeeded, and False otherwise.

``handle_exception(error)``
    If implemented, this method is called when any error occurs during the
    handling of a connection (e.g. if an ``smtp_<command>()`` method raises an
    exception).  The exception object is passed in.  This method *must* return
    a status string, such as ``'542 Internal server error'``.  If the method
    returns None or raises an exception, an exception will be logged, and a 500
    code will be returned to the client.


Built-in handlers
=================

The following built-in handlers can be imported from ``aiosmtpd.handlers``:

* ``Debugging`` - this class prints the contents of the received messages to a
  given output stream.  Programmatically, you can pass the stream to print to
  into the constructor.  When specified on the command line, the positional
  argument must either be the string ``stdout`` or ``stderr`` indicating which
  stream to use.

* ``Proxy`` - this class is a relatively simple SMTP proxy; it forwards
  messages to a remote host and port.  The constructor takes the host name and
  port as positional arguments.  This class cannot be used on the command
  line.

* ``Sink`` - this class just consumes and discards messages.  It's essentially
  the "no op" handler.  It can be used on the command line, but accepts no
  positional arguments.

* ``Message`` - this class is a base class (it must be subclassed) which
  converts the message content into a message instance.  The class used to
  create these instances can be passed to the constructor, and defaults to
  `email.message.Message`_.

  This message instance gains a few additional headers (e.g. ``X-Peer``,
  ``X-MailFrom``, and ``X-RcptTo``).  You can override this behavior by
  overriding the ``prepare_message()`` method, which takes a session and an
  envelope.  The message instance is then passed to the handler's
  ``handle_message()`` method.  It is this method that must be implemented in
  the subclass.  ``prepare_message()`` and ``handle_message()`` are both
  called *synchronously*.  This handler cannot be used on the command line.

* ``AsyncMessage`` - a subclass of the ``Message`` handler, with the only
  difference being that ``handle_message()`` is called *asynchronously*.  This
  handler cannot be used on the command line.

* ``Mailbox`` - a subclass of the ``Message`` handler which adds the messages
  to a Maildir_.  See below for details.


The Mailbox handler
===================

A convenient handler is the ``Mailbox`` handler, which stores incoming
messages into a maildir::

    >>> import os
    >>> from aiosmtpd.controller import Controller
    >>> from aiosmtpd.handlers import Mailbox
    >>> from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory
    >>> # Clean up the temporary directory at the end of this doctest.
    >>> tempdir = resources.enter_context(TemporaryDirectory())

    >>> maildir_path = os.path.join(tempdir, 'maildir')
    >>> controller = Controller(Mailbox(maildir_path))
    >>> controller.start()
    >>> # Arrange for the controller to be stopped at the end of this doctest.
    >>> ignore = resources.callback(controller.stop)

Now we can connect to the server and send it a message...

    >>> from smtplib import SMTP
    >>> client = SMTP(controller.hostname, controller.port)
    >>> client.sendmail('aperson@example.com', ['bperson@example.com'], """\
    ... From: Anne Person <anne@example.com>
    ... To: Bart Person <bart@example.com>
    ... Subject: A test
    ... Message-ID: <ant>
    ...
    ... Hi Bart, this is Anne.
    ... """)
    {}

...and a second message...

    >>> client.sendmail('cperson@example.com', ['dperson@example.com'], """\
    ... From: Cate Person <cate@example.com>
    ... To: Dave Person <dave@example.com>
    ... Subject: A test
    ... Message-ID: <bee>
    ...
    ... Hi Dave, this is Cate.
    ... """)
    {}

...and a third message.

    >>> client.sendmail('eperson@example.com', ['fperson@example.com'], """\
    ... From: Elle Person <elle@example.com>
    ... To: Fred Person <fred@example.com>
    ... Subject: A test
    ... Message-ID: <cat>
    ...
    ... Hi Fred, this is Elle.
    ... """)
    {}

We open up the mailbox again, and all three messages are waiting for us.

    >>> from mailbox import Maildir
    >>> from operator import itemgetter
    >>> mailbox = Maildir(maildir_path)
    >>> messages = sorted(mailbox, key=itemgetter('message-id'))
    >>> for message in messages:
    ...     print(message['Message-ID'], message['From'], message['To'])
    <ant> Anne Person <anne@example.com> Bart Person <bart@example.com>
    <bee> Cate Person <cate@example.com> Dave Person <dave@example.com>
    <cat> Elle Person <elle@example.com> Fred Person <fred@example.com>
