=========================
Reporting Vulnerabilities
=========================

**⚠️ Please do not file public GitHub issues for security
vulnerabilities as they are open for everyone to see! ⚠️**

We encourage responsible disclosure practices for security vulnerabilities.

If you believe you've found a security-related bug, email `Andrew Svetlov
<mailto:andrew.svetlov+aio-libs-security@gmail.com>`_ and/or
`Pandu POLUAN <mailto:pepoluan+aiosmtpd@gmail.com>`_
instead of filing a ticket or posting to any public groups.
We'll try to assess the problem and disclose it in a responsible way.
